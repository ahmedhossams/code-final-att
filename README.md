🔒 HTTP-Only Cookies: Industry Standard for Authentication Security
HTTP-only cookies are widely adopted as an industry standard for authentication security due to several critical security advantages:

Protection Against XSS Attacks
HTTP-only cookies cannot be accessed via JavaScript, preventing malicious scripts from stealing authentication tokens. This is crucial because Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, are one of the most common web vulnerabilities.

Automatic Transmission
HTTP-only cookies are automatically included in HTTP requests to the server, eliminating the need for manual token management in client-side code. This reduces the risk of accidental token exposure in browser storage or application code.

Secure Storage
Unlike localStorage or sessionStorage (which are accessible via JavaScript), HTTP-only cookies provide a secure storage mechanism that browsers protect from client-side access. This prevents tokens from being compromised through browser extensions or malicious scripts.

CSRF Protection Integration
When combined with CSRF tokens, HTTP-only cookies provide comprehensive protection against both XSS and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, creating a defense-in-depth security strategy.

Industry Adoption
Major platforms like Google, Facebook, and enterprise applications universally use HTTP-only cookies for session management because they provide the strongest protection against client-side attacks while maintaining usability.

Implementation Best Practices
Always set the HttpOnly flag to true for authentication cookies
Use the Secure flag in production to ensure HTTPS-only transmission
Implement proper SameSite attributes to prevent CSRF attacks
Set appropriate expiration times and implement secure token refresh mechanisms

4. Run the Application
dotnet run
The application will start on:

HTTP: http://localhost:5000
HTTPS: https://localhost:5001
5. Access the API
Once the application is running, you can:

Swagger UI: Visit https://localhost:5001/swagger to explore and test the API
API Documentation: Interactive API documentation with try-it functionality

🔐 Authentication
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
User Roles
Student: Can view their own attendance and course information
Instructor: Can manage courses, attendance, and assignments
Admin: Full system access
🗄️ Database Schema
The application uses the following main entities:

Users: Base user accounts with authentication
Students: Student profiles linked to users
Instructors: Instructor profiles linked to users
Courses: Course information with instructor assignments
Enrollments: Many-to-many relationship between students and courses
Attendances: Attendance records for students in courses
Classrooms: Physical classroom information
Assignments: Course assignments with due dates
🧪 Testing the API
A PowerShell test script is included (test-api.ps1) to help you test the API endpoints. You can also use the Swagger UI for interactive testing.

Example API Call
# Register a new user
curl -X POST "https://localhost:5001/api/Auth/register" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "John Doe",
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "password": "password123",
